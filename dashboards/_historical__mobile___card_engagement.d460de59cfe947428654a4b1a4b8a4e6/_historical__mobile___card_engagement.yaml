      Analytics Dashboard for Mobile Personal Finance Cards

      1. Use filters to set Date Range (Past 3 Days, 7 days, 1 Month, 3 Months, 1 Year)
      2. Click on column names in table to arrange by Increasing or Decreasing (for that column)
      a. Further subset by setting filters on minimum views, clicks, or marked, as well as a low/high CTR (Click-Through-Rate) Range
      i. i.e. If you want to see cards with click through rates (CTR) above 20%, AND that have at least 100 clicks...
      Set Filters: Low_CTR_Range to >= 20% and Minimum_Clicks >= 100

      Terms:
      VTR = View-Through-Rate (Generated to Viewed Funnel)
      CTR = Click-Through-Rate (Viewed to Clicked Funnel)
      MTR = Mark-Through-Rate (Clicked to Marked Funnel)
      Net Helpful Score = Count Helpful - Count Unhelpful (i.e.Positive score = more people found it helpful then unhelpful)
